# FOOTPRINTS ACROSS THE OCEAN: A DIGITAL EXPERIENCE

**Proposal – Based on "A Moving Mountain" by Md Nafisul Hasan Sami**

## Project Overview

This project brings a digital dimension to "A Moving Mountain – Dow Jones Performance in the First Decade of the 21st Century" by artist Dr. Gan Yu. The original artwork is a 20-foot-long ink painting depicting the rise and fall of the stock market from 2000 to 2009, blending financial data with expressive, mountainous landscapes. Visitors are invited to write directly on the artwork, making it a living piece of group art.

My project takes this concept and extends it into a digital world. Visitors can engage with a digital version of the painting, either by:

- Using their phones to scan a QR code at the exhibition and leave a comment
- Writing on a touchscreen or tablet at the gallery, using a stylus or keyboard
- Viewing a live digital projection of the painting with everyone's contributions visible in real-time

These messages—written in any language—will appear like ink marks, notes, or layers on the canvas, creating a collaborative visual piece that grows throughout the exhibition. The project allows participation from both in-person and remote visitors, ensuring everyone has a voice in the conversation.

## Core Interactive Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Digital Canvas** | A high-resolution version of A Moving Mountain hosted online, divided by year (2000–2009), with the ability to zoom and explore each panel |
| **Ink Note Comments** | Visitors can leave short reflections, which appear as digital ink notes on the artwork (styled with handwritten or calligraphic effects) |
| **Language Filter** | Users can view comments by language, year, or emotion |
| **Live Writing Table** | A touchscreen or tablet at the gallery allows visitors to write directly into the digital version using a stylus or keyboard |
| **Real-Time Updates** | All messages update live on the canvas for others to see, mimicking the evolving, crowd-powered nature of the original piece |
| **QR Code Access** | Easily accessible via mobile devices, no app needed |

## Project Outcomes

By the end of the 6 weeks, this project will produce:

- A fully functional website that hosts an interactive version of A Moving Mountain
- A living, growing artwork where visitors write their reflections digitally
- A user-friendly mobile and tablet experience that people can use at the gallery or from home
- A way for people to participate in multiple languages, making it feel global and inclusive
- A digital experience that preserves the artwork's emotional and cultural meaning long after the exhibition ends

## Week-by-Week Timeline (Realistic Full-Time 6-Week Plan)

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Week 1** | Study the original artwork and past visitor comments; meet with Dr. Gan Yu; design the layout and website structure |
| **Week 2** | Begin building the website; digitize the artwork and divide into panels by year; create the QR access system |
| **Week 3** | Build the "write on canvas" feature using stylized input; connect Firebase (or a similar tool) for storing live comments |
| **Week 4** | Add filters (language, year); create tablet interaction mode; style the comment display to feel natural and artistic |
| **Week 5** | Begin testing with mock users; fix bugs; install/test touchscreen/tablet setup; optimize mobile experience |
| **Week 6** | Final polish; present working website with real comments; prepare final writeup and visuals for Schmucker Gallery team |



## Why This Matters

This project preserves and extends the original purpose of A Moving Mountain—inviting the public to collaborate, reflect, and be part of the art. The digital version not only makes the experience accessible to more people but also ensures that the community's voices are recorded, shared, and remembered.

It bridges art, data, language, and technology—and creates a space where anyone, anywhere, can make their mark.
